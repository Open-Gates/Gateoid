Hey there, {0}! Welcome to **Open Gates**!

Normally, Gateoid, your friendly neighbourhood Open Gates bot, would be writing this post!
He is, however, otherwise occupied (read, his house is dead and won't be revived until after the move).

Some things you can do in this server:
- Read all about us in <#{1}>;
- Introduce yourself in <#{2}>;
- Talk about your favourite games in their dedicated channels;
- Show us photos of your favourite animals;
- Chat about anything and everything in here;
- Lean your chair back just enough to get that thrill;
- Talk to me in <#{3}> when you get lonely.

Have fun!
